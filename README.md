# Book Store Web Application

#### This project involved developing a full-stack web application for managing a virtual bookstore. The system allows users to browse books and add them according to categories, while administrators can add, edit, and delete books in the inventory.

#### E-commerce platforms like online bookstores require efficient database management and dynamic UI design. The project was implemented using frontend and backend technologies, ensuring seamless interaction between users and the system.

#### I worked on designing and developing both the frontend and backend, implementing database operations for managing books. The system allows books to be added according to categories, with validation to prevent empty items and out-of-range values. On the frontend, I created a user-friendly interface with easy navigation and smooth interaction. This project strengthened my expertise in web development, database integration, and building interactive user interfaces.
